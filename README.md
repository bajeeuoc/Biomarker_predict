# Biomarker_predict
This notebook provides a comprehensive guide on building and evaluating a Random Forest model for cancer prediction using Python. Hereâ€™s a summary of its main components
Data Preparation and Loading: The notebook begins by loading a cancer dataset, likely using the popular sklearn library, and performs data exploration to understand key features and target variables.

Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: The data is then preprocessed, which could involve handling missing values, encoding categorical features, or scaling numerical values. These steps ensure the data is ready for the Random Forest model.

Model Training: A Random Forest classifier is implemented. The notebook likely explores hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance, adjusting parameters such as the number of trees, max depth, and split criteria.

Evaluation Metrics: Several metrics are used to evaluate the model, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score, providing a robust assessment of the model's predictive capability.

Visualization: Key plots, such as feature importances, ROC curves, and possibly confusion matrices, help visualize the model's performance and interpretability, shedding light on the most influential features in cancer prediction.
